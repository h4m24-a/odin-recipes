    <h2>Description</h2>
    <p>This time I'm making a deep pan version where the pizza is fried in a hot refractory pan.</p>
    <p>A high edge on the pizza means that it is filled with extra goodies 
        –in this case tomato sauce, cheese and homemade meatballs.</p>

    <h2>Ingredients</h2>

    <p> - Pizza Dough</p>

    <ul>
        <li>300g wheat flour</li>
        <li>1 teaspoon of salt</li>
        <li>1 teaspoon of dry yeast</li>
        <li>200 mL</li>
    </ul>

    <p> - Topping</p>

    <ul>
        <li>1 can of chopped or whole tomatoes (400g)</li>
        <li>1 clove of garlic</li>
        <li>2-3 branches of basil leaves</li>
        <li>Mozzarella</li>
        <li>Meat balls</li>
        <li>Sliced onions, olives, paprika, etc</li>
    </ul>

    <h2>Steps</h2>

    <ol>
        <li>Mix wheat flour with salt and dry yeast and stir together. 
            Add enough lukewarm water until you have a soft dough, preferably a little sticky. 
            Let the dough rest until it has doubled in size.</li>
        <li>Set the oven temp to 250°</li>
        <li>Use an immersion blender to blend the tomatoes, garlic and basil until smooth. Season with salt and pepper.</li>
        <li>Place the pan in the hot oven for 10 minutes to warm it up.</li>
        <li>Divide the dough in half. Roll out one half into a circle larger than your pan (you want a high pizza edge). Cover the other half for now.</li>
        <li>Place the pizza dough in the hot pan. Sprinkle the bottom with some cheese, and place meatballs on top of the sauce.</li>
        <li>Put the pizza in the preheated oven and bake for 7-9 minutes until the pizza bubbles.</li>
        <li>Garnish Pizza with bazil when taken out of oven.</li>
    </ol>
